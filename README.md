#Project Two Backend Team
This is the repo for three front-end teams making different apps based off of the data provided. The database was populated using faker.js and garbage.js. Garbage.js was implemented to make it slightly more difficult for the front-end teams by giving them data they were not expecting. 

#Endpoints for All Teams
####Dictator
GET/POST dictators http://project2-backend.herokuapp.com/api/dictators

GET single dictator http://project2-backend.herokuapp.com/api/dictators/:id

####Household
GET/POST owned_households http://project2-backend.herokuapp.com/api/dictators/:id/households

GET  single owned_household http://project2-backend.herokuapp.com/api/dictators/:id/households/:id

####User
GET/POST users http://project2-backend.herokuapp.com/api/dictators/:id/households/:id/users 

#NPM & Dependencies
The node_modules folder is not included in the repo, however the package.json file will fetch them for you if you type ```$ npm install```. 

#Setting up your local MongoDB
Here is a tutorial on how to install MongoDB and then how to set up mongoDB locally and finally how to create documents which basically means "putting stuff in your batabase so you can see it."

####Try this quickstart first...

MongoDB Quick Install/Setup Guide - Assumes you have Homebrew installed.

```$ brew update``` to make sure it's aware of the latest version of Mongo

```$ brew install``` MongoDB to install MongoDB

Now set up the place where all of the databases live. By default for Mongo it's /data/db. So type

```$ mkdir -p /data/db```

Make sure that the directory you just created has full read/write privileges.

Now start MongoDB up:

```$ mongod```

You should see an instance of the MongoDB terminal interface running, and you can manipulate the databases from here.

Now create your database for this project. Type

```$ use project2-backend``` in the MongoDB terminal interface and it will create a database named gammadb for you. Naming it project2-backend will ensure that the code in this repo will point to a local db that you can use to develop locally.

#Postman for talking to the API/database
You can talk to your db through the mongo CLI, but [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is easier to use.

#Testing on a local database (instead of having to push to Heroku all the time).
This assumes that you have already installed MongoDB as described above, or in the MongoDB docs.

Make sure you have mongodb server running by typing ```$ mongod```

Open up a new tab and type ```$ mongo``` to get the MongoDB CLI running. Inside the mongo CLI, type ```$ use project2-backend``` to make sure you're on project2-backend.

In a new tab, type ```$ node server.js```

In Postman, use http://localhost:8080/api/dictators instead of the heroku url. This allows you to test locally without having to push to Heroku and wait for it to build every time you make a change.

In order to test if everything is working, create a dictator and then go to the Mongo CLI (which is running in your terminal because you already typed ```$ mongo``` in a previous tab) and type ```db.dictators.find()```. If the new document you created with Postman shows up, then everything is set up correctly.

#Database hosted on Heroku with MongoLabs
The project2-backend MongDB database is hosted on Heroku via [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/). [Docs about connecting to MongoLab are here](http://docs.mongolab.com/connecting). URL: https://project2-backend.herokuapp.com/api/dictators

#Miscellaneous
The data was generated by using faker.js and garbage.js. Users were generated first as a JSON file and imported into MongoLab. This allowed the Users to have an autogenerated _id by Mongo. Then the Users collection was exported out. Next Households was created using the exported Users, then the import/export step was repeated for Households. Finally, Dictators was created using the same process.
